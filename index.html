  <h1>Privacy Policy for Podcast & Book Suggester Extension</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last updated: [Insert Date]</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Thank you for using the Podcast & Book Suggester Extension (the “Extension”). This policy describes how the Extension accesses and processes data in order to suggest podcasts and books related to the content you are viewing on a webpage.
  </p>

  <h2>How the Extension Works</h2>
  <p>
    When you visit a webpage, the Extension fetches the content of the page and sends the relevant portions of that content to Gemini AI for analysis. Based on this content, Gemini AI returns recommendations for a podcast link and a book title that relate to the topic.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Extension then displays these suggestions in its popup interface for your convenience.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>No Personal Data or User Content Storage:</strong><br>
    The Extension does not collect, save, or store any personally identifiable information (PII) or the content of the webpages that you visit. The content is only used momentarily to generate recommendations and is not retained in any database or log.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Processing:</strong><br>
    The content from the webpage is processed in real time. It is sent to Gemini AI solely for the purpose of generating related podcast and book suggestions. Once the suggestions are received and displayed, neither the webpage content nor the generated data is stored.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take your privacy seriously. While the Extension sends webpage content to Gemini AI to generate recommendations, no personal information is retained on our end. All processing is done transiently and securely.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
